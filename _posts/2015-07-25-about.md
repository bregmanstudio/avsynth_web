This workshop brings together **creative computer scientists, programmers, musicians, and visual artists** for a collaborative three day workshop on audio and visual synthesis techniques and applications. 

The workshop will be located in a remote setting where participants will have free reign to roam the grounds, take hikes, and gather by a campfire at night. The evenings include performances and collective AV synthesis improvs.

We invite researchers and artists who are developing and applying new techniques for audio and visual synthesis. Please visit [last year's site](http://digitalmusics.dartmouth.edu/~avsynth) to get a sense of what to expect. We're accepting aplications for participation in any of the following categories.

### Tutorials
Tutorials are 30 minutes in length, with additonal time for questions. We encourage researchers and artists to submit abstracts on topics related to signal synthesis, performance, and composition.

### Posters/Demos
There will be several sessions during which attendees will set up posters and demos in parallel. Others will roam around for one-on-one conversations and discussion.

### Performance Pieces
Friday and Saturday evening will feature a short (~45 min) performace.

### Outdoor Audio or Video Installation
The venue sits against a beautiful rural backdrop. This year we encourage suggestions for outdoor exhibits that take advantage of the setting. Please keep in mind that rain is a possibility; suggested installations should be weather-proof.

## Participate
The workshop is fully collaborative. All participants must:

  - Be able to attend the full workshop, beginning to end.
  - Present their research or creative work in one of the above categories.
